Hello there! My name is Jianhao and I am a software engineer based in Singapore.
I have a strong passion for systems reliability &amp;amp; automation and believe that a product is only as good as how reliable it is for its users.
Also a Marvel fan, food lover, competitive swimmer/lifesaver, aquascaper.
If you can&amp;rsquo;t find me at my desk, I am probably in the kitchen or in the swimming pool/gym.</description></item></channel></rss>
