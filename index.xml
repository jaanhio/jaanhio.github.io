          For those who aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar, node-exporter is a Prometheus exporter that exposes hardware and OS metrics from *NIX kernels.
To get it up and running, there&amp;rsquo;s a simple guide on Prometheus official docs. The issue with the approach is that running node-exporter by executing binary directly isn&amp;rsquo;t the most reliable approach in a production environment as there&amp;rsquo;s no way to ensure that the node_exporter process will run continuously.
This is where systemd comes in.

          Hello there! My name is Jianhao and I am a software engineer based in Singapore.
I am interested in all things about systems reliability, automation, performance and believe that a product is only as good as how reliable it is for its users.
Also a Marvel fan, food lover, competitive swimmer/lifesaver, aquascaper.
Memory isn&amp;rsquo;t my greatest strength, hence the existence of this page which serves as my HA knowledge dumping ground.
