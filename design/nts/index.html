      <h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<ul>
<li>think about how we think an area in the house will be used</li>
<li>take into account how natural light enters and moves within the house</li>
<li>consider how movement is like based on a certain layout - there should be sufficient space (70-90cm clearance) for people to move about</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="style">Style</h2>
<ul>
<li>style evolves over time</li>
<li>its not necessary to have every element in the space be cohesive. its about telling a story with the furnitures picked that gives the overall design a sense of character</li>
<li>when it comes to color, anchoring with a base tone can make it easier to decide on other cohesive colors to create a sense of harmony and visual calm</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t be afraid with adding pops of color</li>
<li>a layout looks pleasing when there&rsquo;s a focal point for our eyes to rest on
<ul>
<li>placement of pieces should follow <code>the Golden Ratio</code> (1:1.618) or <code>Rules of Thirds</code> (widely used in photography to find optimal composition)</li>
<li>use contrast to provide balance e.g pops of greenery in room with light colored wood and concrete walls
<ul>
<li>warm vs cold colors</li>
<li>round vs angular shapes</li>
<li>varying height of furnitures (like how a cityscape in Tokyo looks interesting due to the vast number of buildings with different heights and design compared to the monotonous HDB layouts in SG)</li>
<li>varying textures used</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="zoning">Zoning</h2>
<ul>
<li>creating zones can help transition between tasks and modes and can make a room feel larger, more spacious and organized</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s common to think of different rooms or physical partitions to create zones but this can be achieved in a more dynamic way that can still be functional</li>
<li>use bulky furnitures such as sofas, TV cabinets to act as subtle barriers for zones - achieve separation without the use of walls that can make a place look smaller</li>
<li>curtains, sliding doors, book shelves are some ways to divide space without the permanence of walls</li>
<li>use of different colors, materials and finishes can also create zoning by breaking the continuity</li>
<li>different lighting can also set the various zones e.g small task light over a sofa, decorative light over dining table</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="furniture--furnishings">Furniture &amp; furnishings</h2>
<ul>
<li>start with the largest pieces of furniture first (e.g sofa) to serve as a base with which we pick the other furnishings</li>
<li>choosing a sofa
<ul>
<li>always measure and test if it fits within a living space (use tapes on the floor to mark the dimensions)</li>
<li>consider using sofa bed for greater dual functionality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>picking furniture and furnishings that is lifted off the ground will show more floor space and make a place feel larger</li>
<li>furnitures lower in height can create the illusion of more space
<ul>
<li>must still follow the <code>Golden Ratio</code> and <code>Rules of Thirds</code> else it will look out of place</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pick multifunctional furniture where applicable (e.g combining a flooring with storage underneath)</li>
<li>rugs can be used for
<ul>
<li>zoning</li>
<li>helping to anchor other furniture</li>
<li>style</li>
<li>soften acoustics of a space, especially when</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 ways of using rugs
<ul>
<li>front legs only on rug - suitable for smaller rugs</li>
<li>all legs on rug - rug should extend at least 150mm past each furniture</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<ul>
<li>having tall and long units can make space feel larger and taller</li>
<li>having a clever break in shelving in the vertical middle can add a sense of openness compared to a continuous shelving</li>
<li>ensure shelving is the right size to store belonging without being too bulky</li>
<li>consider mix of open and close shelving and cabinets</li>
<li>use of glass cover can allow light to pass and make furnishing look lighter</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="maximizing-awkward-spaces">Maximizing awkward spaces</h2>
<ul>
<li>peg board is a way to maximize space</li>
<li>hooks and mirrors are also ways to make entryways more interesting</li>
<li>add cabinets and shelves on awkward corners for efficient storage and workspaces</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lighting">Lighting</h2>
<ul>
<li>use multiple layers of lighting to cover design and functional needs</li>
<li>accent lighting - draw focus on specific features e.g led light strip above a shelf</li>
<li>task lighting - functional lighting for everyday activities e.g light for cooking</li>
<li>ambient lighting - main source of lighting in a room  that is soft</li>
<li>avoid using only downlights - practical but harsh</li>
<li>lighting can oth serve functional and design needs</li>
<li>make lighting dimmable</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-make-small-spaces-feel-bigger">How to make small spaces feel bigger</h2>
<ul>
<li>reduce visual clutter by ensuring every item has its space - rarely used items should be kept away</li>
<li>mirrors can create an illusion of a bigger space</li>
<li>consistent and continuous use of similar materials throughout a space to prevent it from looking too divided</li>
<li>use lighter color paint</li>
<li>use higher gloss paint in ceiling to bounce light off and make space look larger</li>
<li>sliding &amp; folding &amp; pocket doors are usually more space-saving, allowing better use of a space due to smaller opening radius</li>
</ul>
