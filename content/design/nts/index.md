## Layout

* think about how we think an area in the house will be used
* take into account how natural light enters and moves within the house
* consider how movement is like based on a certain layout - there should be sufficient space (70-90cm clearance) for people to move about

## Style

* style evolves over time
* its not necessary to have every element in the space be cohesive. its about telling a story with the furnitures picked that gives the overall design a sense of character
* when it comes to color, anchoring with a base tone can make it easier to decide on other cohesive colors to create a sense of harmony and visual calm
* don't be afraid with adding pops of color
* a layout looks pleasing when there's a focal point for our eyes to rest on
    * placement of pieces should follow `the Golden Ratio` (1:1.618) or `Rules of Thirds` (widely used in photography to find optimal composition)
    * use contrast to provide balance e.g pops of greenery in room with light colored wood and concrete walls
        * warm vs cold colors
        * round vs angular shapes
        * varying height of furnitures (like how a cityscape in Tokyo looks interesting due to the vast number of buildings with different heights and design compared to the monotonous HDB layouts in SG)
        * varying textures used

## Zoning
* creating zones can help transition between tasks and modes and can make a room feel larger, more spacious and organized
* it's common to think of different rooms or physical partitions to create zones but this can be achieved in a more dynamic way that can still be functional
* use bulky furnitures such as sofas, TV cabinets to act as subtle barriers for zones - achieve separation without the use of walls that can make a place look smaller
* curtains, sliding doors, book shelves are some ways to divide space without the permanence of walls
* use of different colors, materials and finishes can also create zoning by breaking the continuity
* different lighting can also set the various zones e.g small task light over a sofa, decorative light over dining table

## Furniture & furnishings
* start with the largest pieces of furniture first (e.g sofa) to serve as a base with which we pick the other furnishings
* choosing a sofa
    * always measure and test if it fits within a living space (use tapes on the floor to mark the dimensions)
    * consider using sofa bed for greater dual functionality
* picking furniture and furnishings that is lifted off the ground will show more floor space and make a place feel larger
* furnitures lower in height can create the illusion of more space
    * must still follow the `Golden Ratio` and `Rules of Thirds` else it will look out of place
* pick multifunctional furniture where applicable (e.g combining a flooring with storage underneath)
* rugs can be used for
    * zoning
    * helping to anchor other furniture
    * style
    * soften acoustics of a space, especially when
* 2 ways of using rugs
    * front legs only on rug - suitable for smaller rugs
    * all legs on rug - rug should extend at least 150mm past each furniture

## Storage
* having tall and long units can make space feel larger and taller
* having a clever break in shelving in the vertical middle can add a sense of openness compared to a continuous shelving
* ensure shelving is the right size to store belonging without being too bulky
* consider mix of open and close shelving and cabinets
* use of glass cover can allow light to pass and make furnishing look lighter

## Maximizing awkward spaces
* peg board is a way to maximize space
* hooks and mirrors are also ways to make entryways more interesting
* add cabinets and shelves on awkward corners for efficient storage and workspaces

## Lighting
* use multiple layers of lighting to cover design and functional needs
* accent lighting - draw focus on specific features e.g led light strip above a shelf
* task lighting - functional lighting for everyday activities e.g light for cooking
* ambient lighting - main source of lighting in a room  that is soft
* avoid using only downlights - practical but harsh
* lighting can oth serve functional and design needs
* make lighting dimmable

## How to make small spaces feel bigger
* reduce visual clutter by ensuring every item has its space - rarely used items should be kept away
* mirrors can create an illusion of a bigger space
* consistent and continuous use of similar materials throughout a space to prevent it from looking too divided
* use lighter color paint
* use higher gloss paint in ceiling to bounce light off and make space look larger
* sliding & folding & pocket doors are usually more space-saving, allowing better use of a space due to smaller opening radius
