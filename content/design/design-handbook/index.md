## What makes you feel good?
* understand your needs and requirements before diving straight into aesthetics
* understand what makes you feel at ease
* identify what you do not like

## Basic principles and rules of thumb
* golden ratio
* rule of thirds
* triangles & three-point thinking - position objects such that their outline forms a triangle
* the optical midpoint - optical center lies about 10% above the geometric center
* focal points - every room should have a focal point to capture the attention
* use leading lines to lead eyes to a place or object and to achieve depth
* lines can also give the illusion of taller or wider space
* curved lines can provide a touch a gentleness
* visual weight
    * heavy vs light style
        * larger vs smaller objects
        * dark vs light colors
        * strong vs mild contrasts
        * warm vs cold shades
        * objects in corners or on the edge vs objects close to the center
        * diagional lines vs horizontal lines
        * complex vs simple shapes
    * use heavy style in a large open space vs use light style in a tighter space
* anchoring - a visual center of gravity to calm the space and makes it feel harmonious instead of drawing visual attention e.g rug in the living room to group furniture together instead of floating individual pieces
    * different room has different anchor piece
    * when choosing colors for a room, better balance is achieved if you follow the way nature uses color - heavier at the bottom and lighter towards the ceiling
    * this can also be applied to other design aspects based on the visual weight - heavy bottom and lighter top
* odd numbers rule
* contrast and juxtaposition - achieved by mixing heavier & lighter style
    * hard vs soft
    * straight vs curved
    * angular vs rounded
    * dark vs light
    * stiff vs supple
    * matte vs glossy
    * large vs small
    * compact vs perforated, light
    * single color vs patterned
    * warm vs cold
    * high vs low
    * textured vs smooth
* use common denominator between styles to strike a balance e.g color or fabric
* textures and tactile surfaces - use a mixture of these to avoid a flat looking interior
    * tactile texture e.g touching a soft carpet
    * visual texture e.g use of light to emphasize difference in materials and ability to create different look
    * rough and uneven surfaces can make a room feel darker, smaller and more cosy
    * smooth and shiny surfaces can make a room feel lighter, colder and more modern
* symmetrical compositions adds a touch of grandeur and elegance - avoid excessive use else interior will look a little too polished and unnatural
    * mirror symmetry
    * rotation symmetry
    * translation symmetry
* vary size and scale of furniture to avoid monotony and bring dynamism
    * e.g varying size of pillows, plant size, art pieces
* use of empty spaces is important to achieve balance in overall experiences
    * hanging a single picture with lots of empty space around it
    * use negative space to emphasize natural light
* flow plan of movement around house - these affects the dimensions & types of material to use
* doorways tends to divide rooms into invisible zones
    * transition zones is the space directly inside a doorway, which allows people to stop and take in the room. this is where a focal point or point of interest can be used to catch their attention
* different kinds of movement flows
    * service-related flow - why someone is moving into a space and tasks executed
    * work-related flow - how do you move between different workstations in a room, or between sink/fridge/stove in kitchen
    * family flow - how does family members move and places that are likely to be congested
    * guest flow - how do guests move, isolating private areas of the room
* isovist - sight lines and visibility
    * similar to certain feng shui guidelines about how furniture are positioned to provide a secure feeling e.g back to facing door or passage way. adding shelves/plants to construct nooks and shelters
* 2:8 storage principle - visual noise of a home can be minimized by allowing only 20% of things be visible and putting away the remaining 80%
    * storage should be strategically placed close to traffic flow
    * avoid having open storage places in a sight line since they can disturb the feel of several rooms simultaneously

## Tools to bring it all together
* sight lines and axiality - concept of enfilade and sight lines where rooms that can be seen all at  once (e.g open concept layout) must have harmonious design
    * draw sight lines on floor plan
* the red thread - a commonality that ties the design on an interior together
    * color
    * material
    * design style
* mixing of styles - let one style dominate and another to spice it up. the spicier the style, the smaller it should be. spread the spice instead of concentrating all in one room
* use camera to identify visual noise in a room

## Color
