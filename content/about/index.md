## Hello there! 

My name is Jianhao and I am a software engineer based in Singapore. 

I have a strong passion for systems reliability & automation and believe that a product is only as good as how reliable it is for its users.

Also a Marvel fan, food lover, competitive swimmer/lifesaver, aquascaper.

If you can't find me at my desk, I am probably in the kitchen or in the swimming pool/gym.
