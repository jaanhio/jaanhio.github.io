## Hello there! 

My name is Jianhao and I am a software engineer based in Singapore. 

I am interested in all things about systems reliability, automation, performance (big fan of [Brendan Gregg](https://www.brendangregg.com/)) and believe that a product is only as good as how reliable it is for its users.

This is where I write my about learnings and interesting finds and serve as mine HA knowledge dumping ground.

Also a Marvel fan, food lover, competitive swimmer/lifesaver, aquascaper.

If you can't find me at my desk, I am probably in the kitchen or in the swimming pool/gym.
