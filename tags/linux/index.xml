          What are processes? A process is basically a program in execution and a program is a piece of code which may be a single line or millions of lines long written in a programming language.
When a UNIX machine gets powered up, the kernel will be loaded and complete its initialization process. Once initialization is completed, the kernel creates a set of processes in the user space, including the scheduling of the system management daemon process (usually named init) which has PID 1 and is responsible for running the right complement of services and daemons at any given time.

          For those who aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar, node-exporter is a Prometheus exporter that exposes hardware and OS metrics from *NIX kernels.
To get it up and running, there&amp;rsquo;s a simple guide on Prometheus official docs. The issue with the approach is that running node-exporter by executing binary directly isn&amp;rsquo;t the most reliable approach in a production environment as there&amp;rsquo;s no way to ensure that the node_exporter process will run continuously.
This is where systemd comes in.
