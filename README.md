This page is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and integrated with Cloudflare for use of custom domain plus additional benefits (e.g caching, security etc).

Note: CNAME file has to be added to the `/static` directory in order for github to register the custom domain. Else, it will be removed on every new deploy.
